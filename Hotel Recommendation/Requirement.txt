The dataset is large and informative, I believe you can have a lot of fun with it! Let me put some ideas below to futher inspire kagglers!

Fit a regression model on reviews and score to see which words are more indicative to a higher/lower score
Perform a sentiment analysis on the reviews
Find correlation between reviewer's nationality and scores.
Beautiful and informative visualization on the dataset.
Clustering hotels based on reviews
Simple recommendation engine to the guest who is fond of a special characteristic of hotel.
